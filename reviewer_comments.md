Dear John, Marcelo, and Catherine (cc: managing editor Peter Castine),  
  
I apologize for the long delay with the peer review of your manuscript "From Fiction to Function: Imagining New Instruments Through Design Workshops." As I had mentioned recently to Marcelo, we are happy to accept it on the condition that you make minor revisions, which are described below. We would like to receive your revised revision this month if possible, so that we can include it in the next issue we will be preparing to deliver to MIT Press. Please confirm receipt of this email (we have had some reports of lost messages), give me an estimate of when you expect to be able to send the revision, and let me know of any questions. I look forward to publishing this interesting work.  
  
Best regards,  
Doug

Reviewer A:  
  
This paper reports on a series of workshops conducted with the aim to devise a novel and more precise method for creating new digital musical instruments (DMI). The paper is well situated in current research and brings a fresh approach to an older conundrum: How to imagine and construct new instruments for new kinds of music?  
  
The framing of the paper is focussed on proposing a combination of the open-ended magic machine workshops and the probatio musical blocks, that refer to the concept of instrument inheritance. The proposal is that the open-ended nature of the workshop can be effectively combined with the specific approach of the modular instrument system. The combination of these two structures provides the work with a potential for rigour and a novel contribution, where the thinking behind the probate system provides practical precision while the magic machines provide openness, and in this way, the magic machines can be unstructured as outcomes while the probatio system provides clear possibilities for next steps.  
  
In the introduction, the authors elegantly define HCD and PD and they are clear in their own positioning of the paper. This is very much appreciated. Overall the framing and the scope of the paper is interesting and the methodological structures are well argued for and appropriate for the project.  
  
However, the paper only details the running of two workshops with a bridging exercise (that I assume is meant to facilitate the transition to a modular system) - which leads me to my first recommendation:  

### 1st recommendation:

I would like to record that the authors add a very clear contribution statement for example at the end of the introduction. The overall scope of the project is exciting and novel and the steps reported here are valuable, BUT the intended point is not quite made in the current version. This is not necessarily a problem, but it would be very good to clarify this and explain how the present paper will allow the authors to complete the overall project is future editions of the work.  

### 2nd recommendation

My second comment concerns the general tone of the writing. At the beginning of the "The Design for Performance workshop" chapter there is a notable change, suggesting a gap in time or a different author. This transition could be made to work better, either by more clearly signposting in the text before or simply transitioning with a clear: From the basis if this theoretical frameworks, weâ€¦  

### 3rd recommendation

Overall the description of the workshop could do with having the language tuned a little, by providing a clear and more explicit structure to the reader, it would become easier to follow the descriptions of the events.  

### 4th recommendation

Again at the end, it would be good to have the results and contribution clarified with a clearer description of next steps.  
  
Despite these minor shortcoming the paper does provide the reader with very interesting outcomes. Workshop systems can be hard to modify and combine, and indeed the authors report on difficulties with their version, this however should not be a discouragement, finding ways to take follow-up steps from exploration workshops is a ongoing wicked problem and very worthy of exploration. I am impressed with the thoroughness of the analysis.  
  
Especially, it is interesting to note that the collective nature of activity 3, 4 and 5 lessen the importance of the facilitator and creates a potential mechanism to create common design understandings.  
  
In conclusion, the desire to expand the magic machine workshops into a full cycle MDI design process is *very interesting but importantly not yet achieved*. 

**I believe that the paper would be strengthened by a more clear statement on the intent of the overall project and the specific contribution of the present paper towards that goal.**

## EDITOR’S COMMENTS  
  
The following comments concern details that you can address when sending your revision. However, they are not more important to address than the peer reviewer’s comments; don’t be misled by the number of comments below to assume they carry more weight than what the peer reviewer has requested. Many of them are considerations of the sort that would often be addressed in queries at a later stage when we are actually editing your article. (You can expect more queries at that stage as well.)  
  
Keep the paper anonymous for now, in PDF format. After we study your revised version and have decided that we don’t need to send it back to the peer reviewer, we will ask for a non-anonymous version and full LaTeX sources.  
  
Regarding these “Author comments” at [cmjdb.com](http://cmjdb.com/):  
“This manuscript includes 3.5 pages of appendices that are included in the submission, making the total length of the document 35 pages. While these additional pages can be hosted and linked online, they are included here to accommodate the blind review.”  
— Thank you for your careful attention to the submission guideline stating a maximum of 32 pages. Please do include these materials with the article rather than requiring the reader to follow a link. The stated maximum refers to the initial submission; it is fine for the revision to be a number of pages longer. (Often reviewers request additional material.) Please consider whether it would make sense to turn the current appendices into tables within the article proper. That would save the reader from having to switch back and forth between a discussion and the end of the article. The length of your current Appendix 3 is not a problem; MIT Press can format tables to span more than one page if needed (typically, on pages facing each other).  
  
p. 4  
“While not discussed by the authors, this might also be a correlation to the type of music they perform with their instruments.”  
— Suggested rewording for clarity: We suppose these different motivations might also correlate with the types of music the participants perform with their instruments, although the authors do not discuss that possibility.   
  
p. 9   
“the early stage ideation of new instruments”  
— Either “early stage of ideation” or “early-stage ideation” (hyphenated).  
  
p. 10  
“After the session an informal discussion was held with the participants and observers to get feedback”  
— Append “on the session” or describe what the feedback was on.  
  
“invited to complete an online prescreening questionnaire”  
— Does “prescreening” imply that there was other screening that happened after the study of the questionnaire? If not, “pre” seems redundant and “screening” would suffice. (Perhaps you meant “pre-workshop,” to distinguish from a questionnaire done during the workshop?) The term recurs on p. 15.  
  
p. 14  
The term “key element identification” would be clearer as “identification of key elements,” especially at first occurrence. Later occurrences could be hyphenated for syntactic clarity: “key-element identification” (to avoiding an incorrect parsing as “key identification of elements”).  
  
In the discussion of dot voting, it might be nice to clarify that (I assume) the votes were done once, covering all the designs, not once per design. Is the term “dot votes” a coinage of either Gray et al. (2010) or Gibbons (2019)? I would put it in quotation marks -- placing colored stickers (known as “dot votes”)  
-- and optionally credit the coiner to clarify it’s not your own term. Incidentally, I wouldn’t hyphenate “Dot-voting” in the title of this subsection. Gibbons (2019) doesn’t except when it’s used adjectivally in front of a noun (which is consistent with CMJ style).  
  
p. 16  
“This is consistent with DMI literature”  
— This ***amount of experience**** is consistent with DMI literature?  
  
their “draw the music” index card (as described in the presentations)  
— “presentations” is unclear. How about “(created in Activity 1)”?  
  
p. 18  
“and is presented in the following section.”  
— Readers might think you mean the subsection that immediately follows. -> and is presented in the following section titled “Thematic Analysis.”  
  
p. 20  
“yielded more clear areas of consensus”  
— more areas of clear consensus, or clearer areas of consensus?  
  
p. 23  
“the design activities situated the participants fictional narrative of their own imagining”  
— ***in a*** fictional narrative?  
  
p. 23  
“the Design for Performance workshops were developed as a strategy to generate novel ideas for new DMIs”   
— You use the adjective “novel” many times in this paper. By the time I got to this sentence, I was led to wonder whether the paper should be giving evidence to support the implicit claim that the ideas that were generated in the workshops were actually novel, versus reinventing the wheel. Were all the design ideas actually things that no one in the field has ever described? “Creative” would seem to be a less loaded and more subjective term, one that doesn’t sound like a claim of an objective fact that is crying out for supporting evidence. Can you do something to ward off this potential criticism, probably here and also earlier?  
  
p. 24  
“Additional workshops had been planned to present the prototypes back to the participants for evaluation and feedback, however due to disruptions caused by COVID-19 they were postponed indefinitely. We look forward to continuing our design research in-person with participants when it is safe to do so.”  
— Do these sentences, written almost two years ago, need to be changed to reflect current reality? The same question applies more generally to the whole “Future work” section. I’m very sorry the peer review took so long, potentially requiring rewriting that would have been unnecessary had it been quicker.  
  
p. 25  
“Finally, the comment made by P07”  
— At this point the reader doesn’t remember what comment you’re referring to, so I’d append “about the Frankenstein instrument,” and then delete “(the Frankenstein instrument)” in the next sentence.  
  
References.  
Thank you for adhering to CMJ style for references; many authors are not so careful. A few details:  
— Andersen 2017, El-Shimy 2014:  It would be helpful (not essential) to list not only the institution but also the department.  
— CMJ style requires the book publisher’s city: Cross, Gray, Magnusson, McPherson, Miranda, Muller, Norman 1988 and 2013, Théberge, Wallis  
— Muller: book editor?  
— Gibbons 2019. Date last accessed?  
— Young: page numbers (unless online only)  
  
p. 34 typo: Chiladny -> Chladni  
  
Appendix 3  
— We’d prefer the italicized category headings to start with an uppercase letter, e.g., “Interaction”; “Signals, connections, and mapping”; “Sound production and processing”; etc.  
  
Figures  
  
Figure 2: CMJ’s guidelines ask for the first word in each textual label to start with an uppercase letter, partly to clarify which labels are distinct. For example: “Control” and “Posture” to help avoid a misinterpretation as “Control posture.” It’s certainly not the end of the world if you can’t do this because you don’t have easy access to the original graphics file.  (Just don’t be surprised if people downstream from me ask the same question again.)  
  
Do you think Figure 5 is necessary? If so, it would help if the caption mentioned something more specific in addition to “group discussion,” such as, perhaps, what the person is pointing to or what is being discussed in this particular photo.  
  
Looking ahead: For any photos or diagrams that you did not create, especially ones that are being reprinted from elsewhere, you will need to obtain written permission from the owners (email is fine). I see that Marcelo is a co-author of the article from which Figures 1 and 2 are reused, and presumably the co-authors are fine with reprinting it. Since that’s a proceedings paper, MIT Press probably won’t ask you to get a release from the publisher.  
I imagine one of you is the photographer for each of Figures 3-6, meaning permission isn’t required, but to clarify that, after final acceptance (not in your next revision, which will still be anonymous ) you might end the caption with something like “Photo: <photographer name>.” If the photographer isn’t one of you, append “Used with permission.” (assuming that’s true).  
Related to permissions, it would be nice if the people in the photos had consented to having their images published; did they (or is it still possible to ask them)? MIT Press has not been particular about that, unlike their strictness about obtaining written permission for reprinting copyrighted material.
