abstract = {A study is presented examining the participatory design of digital musical interactions. The study takes into consideration the entire ecology of digital musical interactions including the designer, performer and spectator. A new instrument is developed through iterative participatory design involving a group of performers. Across the study the evolution of creative practice and skill development in an emerging community of practice is examined and a spectator study addresses the cognition of performance and the perception of skill with the instrument. Observations are presented regarding the cognition of a novel interaction and evolving notions of skill. The design process of digital musical interactions is reflected on focusing on involvement of the spectator in design contexts.},

abstract = {Contemporary classical music conductors are often required to perform music that requires a click track for accurate tempo following. Auditory click tracks can be obtrusive as they block an ear and interfere with the conductor's perception of the music being performed. We propose a device and framework that uses the tactile sense to provide a similar functionality.We outline the unique requirements such a system would require gathered from interviews with an expert conductor. A series of prototypes were developed and presented to the conductor in order to design a device to meet these requirements. A test conducted to verify the current system's timing performance showed a mean error of 0.54{\{}{\%}{\}} compared to the audio click track.},

abstract = {This paper presents a wearable, wireless tactile display system which consists of individually controllable vibrotactile actuator devices, called Vibropixels. The design of the system is easily scalable and reconfigurable, allowing for implementation in a variety of applications. The system removes any limit on the number of actuator devices by avoiding both hand-shaking and packet acknowledgement functionality. The number of control messages required is minimized through the use of a exible two-part addressing scheme as well as functions allowing for the generation of multiple actuator envelopes on the devices. Created within an interdisciplinary art-science research project, 145 Vibropixels were utilized in the premier of the artistic installation Haptic Field. Recognizing that the artistic creation process often involves utilizing systems beyond their intended application, we designed our system to allow our collaborators to interact with and potentially modify the system on a hardware, firmware, or software level. Through interviews with our collaborators, we evaluated our system's ability to support the artistic creation process in light of Shneiderman's principles for creativity support tools. While our collaborators mostly used and modified the highest level software tools provided to them, we argue that supporting lower level modifications may still be useful depending upon available time and the knowledge of the user.},

abstract = {Technical communicators have lately become interested in participatory design as a way to structure and guide their research and development efforts, particularly in online media. But attempts to use participatory design - in technical communication and elsewhere - have been hampered because participatory design has typically been seen as an orientation or field rather than a methodology with its own methods, techniques, and acceptable range of research designs. In this article, I work with a range of participatory design sources to describe it as a methodology useful for technical communicators. After providing the historical and methodological grounding for understanding participatory design as a methodology, I describe its research designs, methods, criteria, and limitations. Finally, I provide guidance for applying it to technical communication research.},

abstract = {In human-centred design (HCD), researchers and designers attempt to cooperate with and learn from potential users of the products or services which they are developing. Their goal is to develop products or services that match users' practices, needs and preferences. In this position paper it is argued that HCD practitioners need to deal with two tensions that are inherent in HCD: they need to combine and balance users' knowledge and ideas with their own knowledge and ideas; and they need to combine and balance a concern for understanding current or past practices with a concern for envisioning alternative or future practices. Six HCD approaches - participatory design, ethnography, the lead user approach, contextual design, codesign and empathic design - are discussed in order to argue that these different approaches are different ways to cope with the two tensions. In addition, several examples from practice are provided to illustrate these tensions. Moreover, it is advocated that HCD practitioners critically reflect on their practices, their methods and their own involvement, so that they can more consciously follow specific HCD approaches and more mindfully cope with the two tensions.},

The concept of interactive composing has grown in my work since 1967, at which time I proposed the design for a sequencer-programmable analog synthesis system, subsequently built by the R. A. Moog Co. and installed in the Electronic Music Studio at State University of New York at Albany in December 1969. That system's special capability in automating controls made possible the techniques that led to several compositions, in particular Ideas of Movement at Bolton Landing (1971) (Chadabe 1972), which involved the control of timbre and rhythm interactively with automated controls generated by sequencers, and Echoes (1972) (Chadabe 1975; 1977), in which the sounds performed by an instrumentalist are delayed for a few seconds, then transformed by a sound-processing system, then distributed to various loudspeakers. The transformed sounds appear as distant echoes to which the performer reacts in deciding how to play the next notes.},

@phdthesis{Jorda2005a,
abstract = {This is a dissertation about performing music with computers, and about constructing the tools that will facilitate playing and improvising with these computers. The primary aim of this research is to construct a theoretical framework that could serve in evaluating the potential, the possibilities and the diversity of new digital musical instruments, with the hope that these ideas may inspire and assist the construction of new and powerful instruments with which perform and listen to wonderful new and previously unheard music. Computer-based interactive music systems date back to the late 1960s, initially involving computer-controlled analog synthesizers in concerts or installations. The use of real-time algorithmic composition spread in the 1970s with the work of composers and performers such as David Behrman, Joel Chadabe, Salvatore Martirano, Gordon Mumma or Laurie Spiegel. However the most rapid period of growth probably occurred during the mid 1980s with the MIDI standardization and, subsequently, with the advent of data-flow graphical programming languages such as Max, which made the design and implementation of custom interactive systems simpler than ever before. In spite of this, nearly four decades after the works of these pioneers, the design of computer-based music instruments, and computer music performance and improvisation in general, still seem immature multidisciplinary areas in which knowledge does not behave in incremental and accumulative ways, resulting in the permanent textquoterightreinvention of the wheeltextquoteright. New digital instrument design is a broad field, encompassing highly technological areas (e.g. electronics and sensor technology, sound synthesis and processing techniques, software engineering, etc.), and disciplines related to the study of human behavior (e.g. psychology, physiology, ergonomics and human-computer interaction components, etc.). Much of this focused research attempts to solve independent parts of the problem an approach essential to achieve any progress in this field. However, as this dissertation will show, it is also clearly insufficient. I believe an approach dedicated to the integrated understanding of the whole is the key to achieving fruitful results. Integral studies and approaches, which consider not only ergonomic or technological but also psychological, philosophical, conceptual, musicological, historical and above all, musical issues, even if non-systematic by definition, are necessary for genuine progress. Putting forward the idea that a digital instrument is a conceptual whole, independent of its potential components and features (e.g. the ways it is controlled or its sonic or musical output tendencies), we will investigate the essence and the potential highlights of new digital instruments, the new musical models and the new music making paradigms they can convey. This dissertation begins with the assumption that better new musical instruments based on computers can only be conceived by exploring three parallel paths identifying the quintessence of new digital instruments; what they can bring of really original to the act of music performance; how can they redefine it; identifying the drawbacks or obsolescences of traditional instruments; what limitations or problems could be eliminated, improved or solved; without forgetting the essential generic assets of traditional instruments; those qualities that should never be forgotten nor discarded. The identification of these points is the primary aim of this thesis. There is a complex interconnected relationship between the tasks of imagining, designing and crafting musical computers, and performing and improvising with them. This relationship can only be understood as a permanent work in progress. This thesis comes from my own experience of fifteen years as a luthier-improviser. Therefore the dissertation is both theoretical (or conceptual) and experimental in approach, although the experiments it documents span years, even decades. To better organize this, the thesis is divided in three parts. Part I progressively enlightens the aforementioned three fundamental exploration paths. This is achieved by introducing the new possibilities offered by digital instruments, in addition to providing a thorough overview of current know-how and of the technical and conceptual frameworks in which new instrument designers and researchers are currently working on. Several taxonomies that will help us in developing a more synthetic and clear overview of the whole subject, are also presented. This first part concludes in chapter seven, presenting the first fundamental contribution of this dissertation; a theoretical framework for the evaluation of the expressive possibilities new digital musical instruments can offer to their performers. Part II describes in depth seven musical instruments, the implementations of my journeys into Digital Lutherie, developed during the previous decade. Since all seven are conceptually very different, each of them serves to illustrate several paradigms introduced in Part I. Presented in chronological order, these music instrument also help to clarify and understand of the path that has led me to the conception of the framework previously introduced. Part III incorporates the teachings and conclusions resulting from this evolutionary journey, and present the final milestone of this dissertation the presentation of possible solutions to better accomplish the goals presented at the end of the part I. Finally this dissertation concludes with what could be considered textquoterightmy digital lutherie decaloguetextquoteright which synthesizes most of the ideas introduced in the thesis. As a postlude, I offer the reacTable to be presented as future work. The reacTable is a digital instrument which constitutes the first one conceived from scratch, that takes into account all the concepts introduced in this thesis, the culmination thus far of my journey into Digital Lutherie},

Through a discussion of the Prosthetic Instruments, a family of digital musical instruments we de- signed for use in an interactive dance performance, we dis- cuss four different approaches to manufacturing -- artisanal, building block, rapid prototyping, and industrial. We dis- cuss our use of these different approaches as we strove to reconcile the many conflicting constraints placed upon the instruments' design due to their use as hypothetical prosthetic extensions to dancers' bodies, as aesthetic objects, and as instruments used in a professional touring context. Experiences and lessons learned during the design and manufacturing process are discussed in relation both to these manufacturing approaches as well as to Bill Buxton's concept of artist-spec design.},

@inproceedings{Sullivan2018a,
abstract = {Despite the proliferation of new digital musical instruments (DMIs) coming from a diverse community of designers, researchers and creative practitioners, many of these instruments experience short life cycles and see little actual use in performance. There are a variety of reasons for this, including a lack of established technique and repertoire for new instruments, and the prospect that some designs may be intended for other purposes besides performance. In addition, we propose that many designs may not meet basic functional standards necessary for an instrument to withstand the rigors of real-world performance situations. For active and professional musicians, a DMI might not be viable unless these issues have been specifically addressed in the design process, as much as possible, to ensure trouble-free use during performance. Here we discuss findings from user surveys around the design and use of DMIs in performance, from which we identify primary factors relating to stability, reliability and compatibility that are necessary for their dependable use. We then review the state of the art in new instrument design through 40 years of proceedings from three conferences - ICMC, NIME, and SMC - to see where and how these have been discussed previously. Our review highlights key factors for the design of new instruments to meet the practical demands of real-world use by active musicians.},

abstract = {This thesis documents the formulation of a research-based practice in multimedia art, technology and digital musical instrument design. The primary goal of this research was to investigate the principles and methodologies involved in the structural design of new interactive digital musical instruments aimed at performance by members of the general public, and to identify ways that the design process could be optimized to increase user adoption of these new instruments. The work is presented in two sections. The first covers early studies in user interaction and exploratory works in web and visual design, sound art, installation, and music performance. The second section is dedicated to focused research on digital musical instrument design through two major projects. The first was the design and prototype of the Noisebox, a new digital musical instrument. The purpose of this project was to learn the various stages of instrument design through practical application. A working prototype has been presented and tested, and a second version is currently being built. The second project was a user study that surveyed musicians about digital musical instrument use. It asked questions about background, instrument choice, music styles played, and experiences with and attitudes towards new digital musical instruments. Based on the results of the two research projects, a model of digital musical instrument design is proposed that adopts a user-centered focus, soliciting user input and feedback throughout the design process from conception to final testing. This approach aims to narrow the gap between conceptual design of new instruments and technologies and the actual musicians who would use them.},

In this paper, we document underlying forces that constitute a third wave in HCI and suggest systemic consequences for the CHI community. We provisionally name this the ‘phenomenological matrix'. In the course of creating technologies such as ubiquitous computing, visualization, affective and educational technology, a variety of approaches are addressing issues that are bad fits to prior paradigms, ranging from embodiment to situated meaning to values and social issues. We demonstrate the underlying unity of these approaches, and document how they suggest the centrality of currently marginal criteria for design, evaluation, appreciation, and developmental methodology in CHI work.

However, in contrast to the venerable piano-style keyboard, touch screen controllers lack the tactile feedback many performers find crucial. This paper presents an augmentation system for acoustic and electronic keyboards in which multi-touch capacitive sensors are added to the surface of each key. Each key records the position of fingers on the surface, and by combining this data with MIDI note onsets and aftertouch from the host keyboard, the system functions as a multidimensional polyphonic controller for a wide variety of synthesis software. The paper will discuss general capacitive touch sensor design, keyboard-specific implementation strategies, and the development of a flexible mapping engine using OSC and MIDI.},

This paper traces the "solutionism" critique to its origins in city planning and highlights the original concern with imaging and representation in the design process. It is increasingly cheap and easy to create compelling and seductive images of concept designs, which sell solutions and presume problems. We consider a range of strategies, which explicitly reject the search for "solutions". These include design fiction and critical design but also less well-known techniques, which aim for unuseless, questionable and silly designs. We present two examples of "magic machine" workshops where participants are encouraged to reject realistic premises for possible technological interventions and create absurd propositions from lo-fi materials. We argue that such practices may help researchers resist the impulse towards solutionism and suggest that attention to representation during the ideation process is a key strategy for this.},

abstract = {Over the past four decades, the number, diversity and complexity of digital musical instruments (DMIs) has increased rapidly. There are very few constraints on DMI design as such systems can be easily reconfigured, offering near limitless flexibility for music-making. Given that new acoustic musical instruments have in many cases been created in response to the limitations of available technologies, what motivates the development of new DMIs? We conducted an interview study with ten designers of new DMIs, in order to explore (a) the motivations electronic musicians may have for wanting to build their own instruments; and (b) the extent to which these motivations relate to the context in which the artist works and performs (academic vs club settings). We found that four categories of motivation were mentioned most often: M1 – wanting to bring greater embodiment to the activity of performing and producing electronic music; M2 – wanting to improve audience experiences of DMI performances; M3 – wanting to develop new sounds, and M4 – wanting to build responsive systems for improvisation. There were also some detectable trends in motivation according to the context in which the artists work and perform. Our results offer the first systematically gathered insights into the motivations for new DMI design. It appears that the challenges of controlling digital sound synthesis drive the development of new DMIs, rather than the shortcomings of any one particular design or existing technology.},

abstract = {The term 'NIME' -New Interfaces for Musical Expression -has come to signify both technical and cultural charac-teristics. Not all new musical instruments are NIMEs, and not all NIMEs are defined as such for the sole ephemeral condition of being new. So, what are the typical charac-teristics of NIMEs and what are their roles in performers' practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers of 78 NIME performers to an on-line questionnaire discussing their performance experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs in the performers' practice and identify the values that are common among performers. We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers, and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose peculiar performance practice results in learning trajecto-ries that often do not lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional performance.},

abstract = {Byte stuffing is a process that encodes a sequence of data bytes that may contain `illegal' or `reserved' values, using a potentially longer sequence that contains no occurrences of these values. The extra length is referred to here as the overhead of the encoding. To date, byte-stuffing algorithms, such as those used by SLIP, PPP, and AX.25, have been designed to incur low average overhead, but little effort has been made to minimize their worst-case overhead. However, there are some increasingly popular network devices whose performance is determined more by the worst case than by the average case. For example, the transmission time for ISM-band packet radio transmitters is strictly limited by FCC regulation. To adhere to this regulation, the current practice is to set the maximum packet size artificially low so that no packet, even after worst-case overhead, can exceed the transmission time limit. This paper presents a new byte-stuffing algorithm, called consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS), which tightly bounds the worst-case overhead. It guarantees, in the worst case, to add no more than 1 byte in 254 to any packet. For large packets, this means that their encoded size is no more than 100.4{\%} of their pre-encoding size. This is much better than the 200{\%} worst-case bound that is common for many byte-stuffing algorithms, and is close to the information-theoretic limit of about 100.07{\%}. Furthermore, the COBS algorithm is computationally cheap, and its average overhead is very competitive with that of existing algorithms.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.

abstract = {The goal of our research is to provide harpists with the tools to control and transform the sounds of their instrument in a natural and musical way. We consider the development of music with live electronics, with particular reference to the harp repertoire, and include interviews with six harpists that use technology in their professional performance practice. We then present HarpCI, a case study that explores how gestures can be used to control and transform sound and light projection in live performance with the electric harp. HarpCI draws on research from the areas Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Music Interaction Design (MiXD) to extend the creative possibilities available to the performer, and demonstrates our approach to bridging the gap between the performer/composer and the harp on one side, and the technology on the other. We discuss the use of guitar pedals with the electric harp, and the limitations they impose, and then introduce the MyoSpat system as a potential solution to this issue. MyoSpat aims to give musicians control over auditory and visual aspects of the performance through easy to learn, intuitive and natural hand gestures. It also aims to enhance the compositional process for instrument and live electronics, through a new way of music notation for gesturally controlled interactive systems. The system uses the Myo{\textregistered} armband gestural controller, a device to control live sound processing that is non-invasive to instrumental technique and performer. The combination of these elements allows the performer to experience a tangible connection between gesture and sound production. Finally, we describe the experience of Eleanor Turner, who composed and performed The Wood and the Water (Turner 2016) using MyoSpat, and we conclude by presenting the outcomes from HarpCI workshops delivered at Cardiff Metropolitan University for Camac Harp Weekend, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire's Integra Lab and Southampton University.},

abstract = {The design of a digital musical instrument is often informed by the needs of the first performance or composition. Following the initial performances, the designer frequently confronts the question of how to build a larger community of performers and composers around the instrument. Later musicians are likely to approach the instrument on different terms than those involved in the design process, so design decisions that promote a successful first performance will not necessarily translate to broader uptake. This article addresses the process of bringing an existing instrument to a wider musical community, including how musician feedback can be used to refine the instrument's design without compromising its identity. As a case study, the article presents the magnetic resonator piano, an electronically augmented acoustic grand piano that uses electromagnets to induce vibrations in the strings. After initial compositions and performances using the instrument, feedback from composers and performers guided refinements to the design, laying the groundwork for a collaborative project in which six composers wrote pieces for the instrument. The pieces exhibited a striking diversity of style and technique, including instrumental techniques never considered by the designer. The project, which culminated in two concert performances, demonstrates how a new instrument can acquire a community of musicians beyond those initially involved. {\textcopyright} 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {A digital real-time synthesis technique is described that can be implemented readily and inexpensively on almost any computer, including microprocessors. Not only are the algorithms simple to implement in software, but hardware realizations are easily done. Despite the simplicity of the techniques, the sound is surprisingly rich and natural. For musicians interested primarily in performing and composing music, rather than designing instruments, these algorithms provide a welcome new technique. For those interested in instrument design, they open a new field of effective techniques to explore.},

Consisting of a pair of data gloves and exhibited for the first time in 1984, The Hands is a pioneering work in digital devices for performing live music. It is a work that engaged Waisvisz for almost a quarter of a century and, in turn, has inspired many generations of music technologists and performers of live music. Despite being often cited in the relevant literature, however, the documentation concerning the sensor architecture, design, mapping strategies, and development of these data gloves is sparse. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by offering a detailed history behind the development of The Hands. The information contained in this article was retrieved and collated by searching the STEIM archive, interviewing close collaborators of Waisvisz, and browsing through the paper documentation found in his personal folders and office.},

abstract = {The design of traditional musical instruments is a process of incremental refinement over many centuries of innovation. As a result, the shape and form of instruments are well established and recognised across cultures. Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production and er-gonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs that resemble traditional instruments, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs to be suitable for performing strummed harmonic accompaniments to a folk tune. Each instrument possesses a combination of one of two global forms (guitar-like body and a smaller tabletop enclosure) and one of two control mechanisms (physical strings and touch sensors). We conducted a study where both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed musical tasks with each instrument. This study highlights the complex interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing musical cultures and varying levels of expertise.},

This study investigates the effect of structural elements of the score, and the playing of different levels of expression on body movements during a piano performance. Pianists were required to play the same piece in four different performance conditions. Their movements were tracked by an optical motion capture system, and the comparisons that were made between specific parts of the body used, performance condition, and musical score locations were subsequently statistically examined. We found that the head and shoulders exhibited more movement per measure, as well as larger differences between each condition, than the fingers, wrists and lower back. Differences between performance conditions were observed primarily at structurally significant portions of the score, and biomechanical factors also played a role. Moreover, our data supports the view that performers equate playing without expression to playing without nonessential movements.},

Several causes could explain this reality, among them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument. In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance. Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements. For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.},

The abstracts: Frame a problem space, introduce a study, often involving the deployment of a prototype, and conclude with considerations, reflections and discussion. This format is then pastiched in a series of design fictions written for a project investigating new and emerging forms of reproduction in Art. The fictions take the form of "imaginary abstracts" which summarize findings of papers that have not been written about prototypes that do not exist. It is argued that framing concept designs as fictional studies can provide a space for research focused critique and development.},

But how often is it actually used, what is it used to describe, and how does its usage here differ from its usage in other fields of study? This paper presents a linguistic analysis of the motion-related terminology used in all of the papers published in the NIME conference proceedings to date (2001-- 2013). The results show that 'gesture' is in fact used in 62 {\%} of all NIME papers, which is a significantly higher percentage than in other music conferences (ICMC and SMC), and much more frequently than it is used in the HCI and biomechanics communities. The results from a collocation analysis support the claim that 'gesture' is used broadly in the NIME community, and indicate that it ranges from the description of concrete human motion and system control to quite metaphorical applications.},

Mnemonic (rule/style-based) scores are the oldest score models of this type. Lately, reactive, interactive, locative scores have added new options to situative scoring. The body:suit:score is an interface currently developed in collaboration of four labs at Concordia and McGill Universities in Montr{\'{e}}al - an interface that will allow the musical use of all four types of situational score. Musicians are clad in a body-hugging suit with embedded technology - this suit becomes their score interface. Ultimately intended to enable ensembles to move through performance spaces unencumbered by visual scores and their specific locations, the project currently enters its second year of research-creation. The paper discusses the closely intertwined technological, ergonomic, performance-psychology-based and artistic decisions that have led to a first bodysuit prototype - a vibrotactile suit for a solo musician. It will also discuss three etude compositions by Sandeep Bhagwati and Julian Klein for this prototype, and their conceptual approaches to an artistic use of the body:suit:score interface. Finally, the paper discusses next steps and emergent problems and opportunities, both technological and artistic.},

abstract = {In this paper, a model of the harp plucking is developed. It is split into two successive time phases, the sticking and the slipping phases, and uses a mechanical description of the human finger's behavior. The parameters of the model are identified through measurements of the finger/string displacements during the interaction. The validity of the model is verified using a configurable and repeatable robotic finger, enhanced with a silicone layer. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of the model's parameters on the free oscillations of the string. As a result, a direct implementation of the model produces an accurate simulation of a string response to a given finger motion, as compared to experimental data. The set of parameters that govern the plucking action is divided into two groups: Parameters controlled by the harpist and parameters intrinsic to the plucking. The former group and to a lesser extent the latter highly influence the initial conditions of the string vibrations. The simulations of the string's free oscillations highlight the large impact the model parameters have on the sound produced and therefore allows the understanding of how different players on the same instrument can produce a specific/personal sound quality.},

The project began with a concept for a standalone hand-held polyphonic synthesizer called the Noisebox (Figure 1). Several key concepts and strategies were explored and implemented during its development, including: analysis and application of gesture in musical performance, choice of sensors and sensor conditioning, appropriate mapping strategies, and evaluation of user experience. The outcome yielded a functional prototype that fulfilled the initial goal of the project to design and build a working instrument from start to finish. The stage documented here represents the first phase of a longer project. Future phases will conduct user tests to measure the success of the instrument based on performer feedback and refine the design through multiple iterations, leading to a finished instrument.},

By studying effective acoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complex gesture-sound mappings that take advantage of established instrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizations of performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicated practice on a new interface, computer music instrument designers can enhance the expressive quality of computer music performance.},

While the lightweight system was designed for use alongside any instrument, our choice of the concert harp represented a unique case study in gestural control of music. The instrument's large size and physically demanding playing technique leaves the performer with little spare bandwidth to devote to other tasks. A motion capture study analyzed instrumental and ancillary gestures of natural harp performances that could be mapped effectively to control of additional signal processing parameters. The initial findings of the study helped to guide the design of custom gesture control devices and user software, and a new work for solo harpist and electronics was created. We discuss our findings, successes and challenges in the study and design of gesture control for augmented instrumental performance, with particular focus on the concert harp.},

abstract = {The ideation, conception and implementation of new musical interfaces and instruments provide more than the mere construction of digital objects. As physical and digital assemblages, interfaces also act as traces of the authoring entities that created them. Their intentions, likes, dislikes, and ultimate determinations of what is creatively useful all get embedded into the available choices of the interface. In this light, the self-perception of the musical HCI and instrument designer can be seen as occupying a primary importance in the instruments and interfaces that eventually come to be created. The work of a designer who self-identifies as an artist may result in a vastly different outcome than one who considers him or herself to be an entrepreneur, or a scientist, for example. These differing definitions of self as well as their HCI outcomes require their own means of critique, understanding and expectations. All too often, these definitions are unclear, or the considerations of overlapping means of critique remain unexamined. In this paper, I offer five broad cultural categories for understanding contrasting histories, as well as creative and technical discourses surrounding musical HCI production, specifically relating to the New Instruments for Musical Expression community. These are offered to spur conversation toward a more complete and complex definition of the self as a designer and the objects of creation within this context, and are not intended to propose hard limitations or boundaries within the community. To the contrary, they are for consideration as porous and available to permutation and change as circumstance and the community at large sees fit.},

Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.},

@article{Medeiros2014,
abstract = {Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) are musical instruments typically composed of a control surface where user interaction is measured by sensors whose values are mapped to sound synthesis algorithms. These instruments have gained interest among skilled musicians and performers in the last decades leading to artistic practices including musical performance, interactive installations and dance. The creation of DMIs typically involves several areas, among them: arts, design and engineering. The balance between these areas is an essential task in DMI design so that the resulting instruments are aesthetically appealing, robust, and allow responsive, accurate and repeatable sensing. In this paper, we review the use of sensors in the DMI community as manifested in the proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2009-2013). Focusing on the sensor technologies and signal conditioning techniques used by the NIME community. Although it has been claimed that specifications for artistic tools are harder than those for military applications, this study raises a paradox showing that in most of the cases, DMIs are based on a few basic sensors types and unsophisticated engineering solutions, not taking advantage of more advanced sensing, instrumentation and signal processing techniques that could dramatically improve their response. We aim to raise awareness of limitations of any engineering solution and to assert the benefits of advanced electronics instrumentation design in DMIs. For this, we propose the use of specialized sensors such as strain gages, advanced conditioning circuits and signal processing tools such as sensor fusion. We believe that careful electronic instrumentation design may lead to more responsive instruments.},

abstract = {For years the HCI community has struggled to integrate design in research and practice. While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.

abstract = {This paper provides a review of gestural control of sound synthesis in the context of the design and evaluation of digital musical instruments. It discusses research in various areas related to this field and equally focuses on four main topics: analysis of music performers' gestures, gestural capture technologies, real-time sound synthesis methods, and strategies for mapping gesture variables to sound synthesis input parameters. Finally, this approach is illustrated by presenting an application of this research to the control of digital audio effects.},

@inproceedings{Bachmann2003a,
abstract = {This presents the latest design and implementation of the magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensor module. The MARG sensor module is designed for measuring 3-DOF orientations in real time without singularities. Each MARG sensor contains orthogonally mounted triads of micromachined rate sensors, accelerometers, and magnetometers for a total of nine sensor components. With an integrated microcontroller, the overall factor is less than one cubic inch. Digital data output rate is 100 Hz. To simplify calibration procedures and filtering algorithms, it is important that the response of the individual sensor components is linear within the typical operating regions. Experiments were conducted utilizing a precision tilt table and results indicate that all the sensor components are linear. A simple hand calibration method that requires no specialized equipment is also described. It was validated by experiments that indicate hand calibration produces results that are nearly equivalent to those obtained following precision tilt table calibration.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the current status of second generation HCI theory, faced with the challenges brought to HCI by the so-called third wave. In the third wave, the use context and application types are broadened, and intermixed, rela- tive to the focus of the second wave on work. Technology spreads from the workplace to our homes and everyday lives and culture. Using these challenges the paper specifi- cally addresses the topics of multiplicity, context, boundar- ies, experience and participation in order to discuss where second wave theory and conceptions can still be positioned to make a contribution as part of the maturing of our handling of the challenges brought on by the third wave.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of electronics, digital media, ad- vanced materials, and other areas of technology, is open- ing up unprecedented opportunities for musical interface inventors and designers. The possibilities afforded by these new technologies carry with them the challenges of a complex and often confusing array of choices for musi- cal composers and performers. New musical technologies are at least partly responsible for the current explosion of new musical forms, some of which are controversial and challenge traditional definitions of music. Alternative musical controllers, currently the leading edge of the on- going dialogue between technology and musical culture, involve many of the issues covered at past CHI meetings.},

@article{Absar2015,
abstract = {This research describes a user-centered design method for creating nonspeech auditory feedback to enhance information interactions with a visual information system. It involves 2 studies. In the first, a user-centered sound design method is used, based on one originally applied for visually impaired users. Three panels of end users are employed to collaboratively and iteratively design the required nonspeech sounds. The method ensures that the sounds designed are not based on designers' personal or ad hoc choices and instead exploits the creativity of a user group as an application of participatory sound design. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are made for extending the sound design method to novel interfaces and sighted users. A second study involves a formative evaluation of the information system integrated with the designed auditory feedback. This evaluation confirms that the user-centered sound design method leads to the creation of auditory feedback which conveys meaningful information to users.},
